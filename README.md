# 🍽️ RecipeFinderAndMealPlanner

A Flutter app built using **Clean Architecture**, **BLoC for state management**, and **Feature-First folder structure**. The app is modular, scalable, and maintainable.

---

## 🧱 Architecture

This project uses a layered Clean Architecture pattern with:

- **Presentation Layer** (UI + BLoC)
- **Domain Layer** (Entities, UseCases, Repositories)
- **Data Layer** (Models, Repository Implementations)
- **Core Module** (Utilities, Constants, Common Widgets)
- **Feature-First Structure** (Each feature has its own folders)
